## Projects
Here are some of the projects that I have worked on: 

* [Algorithmic Trading](https://github.com/MarkDMunoz/Algorithmic-Trading): Conducted an analysis of a ten-stock portfolio, leveraging risk/return metrics and efficient frontier models. Utilized Berry Coxâ€™s price momentum factors for a 5-year backtest, benchmarking performance against leading indices such as SPY, IWM, and DIA.
